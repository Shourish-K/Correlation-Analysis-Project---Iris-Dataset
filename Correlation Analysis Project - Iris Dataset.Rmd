# ðŸŒ¸ Correlation Analysis Project - Iris Dataset ðŸŒ¸
***

## **1. Introduction**
***

The iris flower is a stunning and diverse genus of flowering plants known for its vibrant colors and intricate petal formations. Named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris, this flower comes in a wide range of colors, including purple, blue, yellow, and white, and symbolizes wisdom, hope, and valor in various cultures.

The Iris dataset, introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, is one of the most well-known datasets in data science and machine learning. This classic dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers, with three species represented: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Fisher used this dataset to illustrate the concept of linear discriminant analysis, a method for distinguishing between categories or classes.

The dataset comprises four features that describe the physical dimensions of the iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. These features were chosen because they provide valuable information for distinguishing between the three iris species, which are visually similar yet have distinct differences in petal and sepal structure.

The Iris dataset is frequently used as a beginnerâ€™s dataset for data analysis and machine learning because of its simplicity, balanced classes, and linearly separable nature. It serves as a great example for demonstrating various classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. Its historical significance and ease of use make it a staple in introductory courses on statistics, machine learning, and data science.

The objective of this project is to develop a technical report that investigates the relationships between pairs of variables in the Iris dataset. By examining these associations, the report aims to reveal how different physical attributes of iris flowers, such as sepal and petal dimensions, are interrelated across the three species. To achieve this, meaningful visualizations like scatter plots will be utilized, providing an intuitive way to observe potential trends and correlations in the data. Additionally, Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient will be calculated for each pair of variables, quantifying the strength and direction of linear associations. This analysis will offer insights into the underlying patterns within the dataset and highlight any significant relationships among the variables.

## **2. Dataset Summary**
***

In this section, we provide a comprehensive summary and description of the Iris dataset to gain a foundational understanding of its structure and content.

To better understand this dataset, we explore these features individually to examine the distributions and ranges within each species. This process involves looking at observations (or rows), which correspond to individual flowers, and allows us to identify patterns and variances in the measurements across species.

Additionally, we analyze the dataset's metadata to examine the data types of each column and better understand the dataset's structure. This step is essential for validating the integrity of the data, ensuring that each feature is stored in a format that allows for accurate analysis.

Furthermore, we delve into statistical descriptors such as the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each feature. These descriptors provide valuable insights into the overall distribution of the data, revealing tendencies within each species, identifying potential outliers, and highlighting differences between the three iris species.

### **2.1 Importing and understanding the dataset**
***

We must start of this project by importing the dataset. In the project's folder their exists a file called "Iris.csv", this file contains all the 150 observations done by Robert A. Fisher. We have pulled this dataset from Kaggle, the title for the dataset is "<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris">Iris Species</a>", and originally belongs to UC Irvine Machine Learning (UCIML) Repository. We import the dataset by the following code:

```r
iris <- read.csv("D:\\USCB CSCI\\SEM 7\\Data Visualization\\Homework\\Correlation-Analysis-Project_Iris-Dataset\\dataset\\Iris.csv")
```

Here we have imported the iris dataset in to the iris data variable, we can further check the type of iris by using the iris function. Note there are more ways to import the dataset, we have used a download csv here, other way is to include through an url. We can clearly see from below that the iris dataset is of the data frame data structure.

```{r checking iris variable type}
  class(iris)
```

Now we explore into the data set by observing information placed in the head and tail of the dataset.

```{r checking head and tail}
  head(iris)
  tail(iris)
```

Through this we can already see that there are 5 data columns, and 1 column that represents the index number for a particular observation that is "Id". The "Id" column is insignificant for analyzing the relations between two variables, but still gives us the understanding about how many rows exist in the data. Lets formally validate that the observation and feature count are consitent with our understanding.

```{r checking count of rows and columns}
  paste("Number of columns: ",ncol(iris))
  paste("Number of rows: ",nrow(iris))
```

We can now confim that there are indeed 150 observations in the dataset. There are 6 variables here, as discussed above the id column is only used for indexing, so there are 5 columns that matter to us validating that observation too. To observe the datatypes of the columns we can simply convert our data.frame to a tibble. A tibble is a modernized data.frame (according to <a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>), that works similarly to a data.frame but has additional features. One additional feature that will help us is that the tibble display the datatypes of each column above their respective column headers, so we will not have to check for each columns datatype individually.

```{r tibble and datatypes}
  iris <- as_tibble(iris)
  head(iris)
```

We can observe that the "Id" is an <int> or integer, the 4 physical features of the Iris are <dbl> or doubles according to tibbles, one can simply think about them as double-precision floating point numerics. Finally the target variable (a.k.a the label) is of type <chr> or character. This represents the type of flower the particular observation represents.

Note that since this is a very popular and small datasets the data in it is already clean, this means that the data has a low amount of errors and that it has no missing values. It is highly recommended that with any dataset one must always explore the data and get familiar with the dataset, and take appropriate measures to clean the data.

### **2.2 Five Number Summary and more**
***

We will now use the `summary()` function of data.frame to get more understating about the distribution of our data, this will give us the five-number summary for the quantitative variables and counts of the categorical variables. We will be excluding the id column here since it is insignificant.

```{r five number summary and more}
  summary(iris[, -c(1)])
```

This summary shows us the statics for each of the physical feature. The statistics include the minimum and maximum values from the columns, along with their central tendancies in the form of mean and median, we also get the Interquartile range (IQR) for each feature. The IQRs help us understand how the data is clustered and can also hep us identify outliers. Outliers are often data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5/IQR or above Q3 + 1.5/IQR. Also, the frequencies of the categorical variables are displayed for them.

## **3. Plotting Data**
***

In this section, we will analyze the relationships between the variables in the Iris dataset by plotting scatterplots. Scatterplots are a fundamental visualization tool in data analysis, offering an intuitive way to examine potential correlations between pairs of variables. By plotting the data points for each pair of variables, we can directly observe patterns, trends, and possible associations, providing insight into the nature of the relationships within the dataset.

Each scatterplot will display one pair of variables on the x- and y-axes, with individual points representing observations of iris flowers. These visualizations will allow us to assess whether there is a positive correlation (where both variables increase together), a negative correlation (where one variable increases as the other decreases), or no correlation (where there is no apparent relationship between the two variables). Scatterplots also allow us to identify clusters or groups in the data and highlight any potential outliers, which could indicate interesting patterns or anomalies in the dataset.

We will further enhance our scatterplots by coloring or shaping points according to the species of the iris flower (e.g., Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica). This approach will help us observe if the relationship between variables is consistent across different species or if it varies significantly. For instance, certain species may exhibit stronger correlations between specific measurements, like Petal Length and Petal Width, compared to others.

By visually exploring these scatterplots, we can develop preliminary insights into the correlations between variables. These observations will then set the stage for more formal statistical analysis, including calculating Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of these relationships. This visualization step is essential in data analysis, as it allows us to recognize patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent from numerical data alone.


### **3.1 Scatterplots**
***
```{r List of variables, echo=FALSE}
  variables <- colnames(iris)[2:5]  # All quantitative variables
```

#### **3.1.1 SepalLengthCM vs SepalWidthCM**
***

The relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width in the Iris dataset reveals a weak, slightly negative correlation, indicating that these two variables are not strongly dependent on each other.

```{r Plot1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[1], y = variables[2])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[1], "vs", variables[2]),
         x = variables[1],
         y = variables[2],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

 A scatterplot of SepalLengthCM versus SepalWidthCM, colored by species, shows that Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster with relatively shorter sepal lengths and wider sepal widths compared to the other species. In contrast, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica display greater overlap, both showing generally longer sepal lengths and narrower widths than setosa. This distinction suggests that sepal dimensions vary by species, with setosa being notably different from the others, while versicolor and virginica exhibit similar sepal characteristics. The low correlation coefficient between Sepal Length and Sepal Width supports the visual observation that changes in one measurement do not predict changes in the other. Overall, the differences in sepal dimensions contribute to distinguishing Iris setosa from the other species but are less helpful in differentiating versicolor and virginica.
<br>
<br>

#### **3.1.2 SepalLengthCM vs PetalLengthCM**
***


The relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length in the Iris dataset exhibits a strong positive correlation, indicating that as Sepal Length increases, Petal Length also tends to increase. 

```{r Plot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[1], y = variables[3])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[1], "vs", variables[3]),
         x = variables[1],
         y = variables[3],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

A scatterplot of SepalLengthCM versus PetalLengthCM, colored by species, illustrates this trend clearly across the three iris species. Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster with shorter sepals and petals, positioned at the lower end of the dimensions, while Iris versicolor and Iris virginica display progressively longer sepal and petal lengths, with virginica reaching the highest measurements. This pattern suggests that Sepal Length and Petal Length are not only strongly associated but also increase systematically from setosa to versicolor to virginica, making them effective variables for distinguishing between the species. The high positive Pearson correlation coefficient further supports this strong relationship, indicating that Sepal Length and Petal Length vary together in a meaningful way. Overall, these features reveal distinct species-specific trends, making them valuable markers for identifying iris species based on their morphological characteristics.
<br>
<br>

#### **3.1.3 SepalLengthCM vs PetalWidthCM**
***

The relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Width in the Iris dataset demonstrates a moderately strong positive correlation, indicating that as Sepal Length increases, Petal Width generally increases as well.

```{r Plot3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[1], y = variables[4])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[1], "vs", variables[4]),
         x = variables[1],
         y = variables[4],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

A scatterplot of SepalLengthCM versus PetalWidthCM, colored by species, clearly illustrates this trend and highlights the distinctions across the three iris species. Iris setosa forms a compact cluster at the lower end of both sepal length and petal width, showing the smallest measurements, while Iris versicolor occupies a mid-range position with moderate sepal and petal sizes. Iris virginica, on the other hand, has the largest dimensions, forming a separate cluster at the higher end of the scatterplot. This pattern suggests that Petal Width and Sepal Length vary in a species-specific way, with a consistent progression from setosa to versicolor to virginica. The calculated Pearson correlation coefficient supports this positive relationship, indicating that the association is statistically significant. Overall, the moderate to strong correlation and clear species-specific clusters reveal that Sepal Length and Petal Width are valuable features for distinguishing between iris species based on their morphological characteristics.
<br>
<br>

#### **3.1.4 SepalWidthCM vs PetalLengthCM**
***


The relationship between Sepal Width and Petal Length in the Iris dataset reveals a weak to moderate negative correlation, suggesting that as Sepal Width increases, Petal Length tends to decrease slightly, though this trend is not very pronounced.

```{r Plot4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[2], y = variables[3])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[2], "vs", variables[3]),
         x = variables[2],
         y = variables[3],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

A scatterplot of SepalWidthCM versus PetalLengthCM, colored by species, visually highlights this relationship and underscores differences among the three iris species. Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster with wider sepals and shorter petals, positioned toward the upper left of the plot. Iris versicolor occupies a middle range, with moderate values for both sepal width and petal length, while Iris virginica has narrower sepals and longer petals, forming a cluster toward the lower right. These species-specific patterns suggest that Sepal Width and Petal Length vary in ways that can help distinguish between species: setosa typically has the widest sepals and shortest petals, while virginica has the narrowest sepals and longest petals. Although the overall Pearson correlation coefficient is low, confirming a weak inverse relationship, these features remain valuable for differentiating species based on their distinct morphological characteristics.
<br>
<br>

#### **3.1.5 SepalWidthCM vs PetalWidthCM**
***

The relationship between Sepal Width and Petal Width in the Iris dataset shows a very weak or nearly nonexistent correlation, suggesting that these two variables are largely independent of each other

```{r Plot5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[2], y = variables[4])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[2], "vs", variables[4]),
         x = variables[2],
         y = variables[4],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

A scatterplot of SepalWidthCM versus PetalWidthCM, colored by species, visually highlights this lack of association and reveals differences across the three iris species. Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster with wider sepals and narrower petals, positioned in the upper left region of the plot. Iris versicolor occupies the central area with moderate values for both sepal and petal widths, while Iris virginica tends to have narrower sepals and relatively wider petals, positioned toward the lower right. Although there is no strong correlation between Sepal Width and Petal Width, as confirmed by a Pearson correlation coefficient close to zero, these species-specific clusters still provide valuable distinctions. This clustering helps differentiate setosa from the other species, particularly given its characteristic of wide sepals and narrow petals. Overall, while Sepal Width and Petal Width do not have a meaningful linear relationship, their individual patterns across species offer insights useful for species classification in the Iris dataset.
<br>
<br>

#### **3.1.6 PetalLengthCM vs PetalWidthCM**
***

The relationship between Petal Length and Petal Width in the Iris dataset demonstrates a strong positive correlation, indicating that as Petal Length increases, Petal Width also tends to increase. 

```{r Plot6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  p <- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes_string(x = variables[3], y = variables[4])) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = iris$Species)) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    labs(title = paste("Scatterplot of", variables[3], "vs", variables[4]),
         x = variables[3],
         y = variables[4],
         color = "Species")
  p
```

A scatterplot of PetalLengthCM versus PetalWidthCM, colored by species, vividly highlights this close association and shows clear distinctions among the three iris species. Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster at the lower end of the plot, with both shorter and narrower petals compared to the other species. Iris versicolor occupies the middle range, displaying moderate petal length and width, while Iris virginica has the longest and widest petals, forming a cluster at the upper right. These species-specific patterns indicate that Petal Length and Petal Width are highly characteristic of each species, with clear separations among setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The high Pearson correlation coefficient supports this strong linear relationship, suggesting that these two petal measurements are closely related. Overall, Petal Length and Petal Width provide an effective basis for distinguishing between the species, making them valuable features for classification based on petal morphology.
